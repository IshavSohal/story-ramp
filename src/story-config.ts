Businesses, institutions and other facilities across Canada must report their releases, transfers and disposals of pollutants to air, water and land annually to the Government of Canada's NPRI. The information collected is public, helps governments set environmental priorities and monitor environmental performance, and provides Canadians with an opportunity to learn about pollution in their surroundings.`

- The Athabasca;

All three of the deposits are located in northern Alberta except for a small portion of the Cold Lake deposit, which extends into Saskatchewan. Together, these deposits cover 142,000 square kilometres and are estimated to contain 166.3 billion barrels.

The oil sands extraction sector is a major contributor to Canadaâ€™s economy, with more than 528,000 people deriving direct, indirect and induced employment from the oil sands and its supporting sectors. To date, [$243 billion of capital expenditures has been invested in the oil sands industry](https://www.nrcan.gc.ca/energy/energy-sources-distribution/crude-oil/what-are-oil-sands/18089), and the sector produces [2.9 million barrels of oil per day](https://www.nrcan.gc.ca/energy/energy-sources-distribution/crude-oil/oil-supply-and-demand/18086).

The oil found in oil sands deposits is primarily bitumen, a very heavy and viscous oil. Bitumen does not flow easily at room temperature and requires unconventional methods to extract. Bitumen is extracted either from surface mining or in-situ using a variety of methods.

The choice between surface mining and thermal in-situ is solely determined by the depth of the oil deposit. Surface mining is used to reach deposits to a maximum depth of 70 meters below the surface; thermal in-situ wells extract bitumen at greater depths.

Surface mining involves digging up large areas with large excavators. The resulting bitumen and sand mixture is mixed with hot water and sodium hydroxide (NaOH) to separate the bitumen. During this process, the bitumen rises to the top of large separation vessels as a froth. This froth bitumen is further processed in a froth treatment unit to extract the bitumen. Most of the material dug up in an oil sands surface mine is clay and sand. The bitumen extracted makes up about 10% of this material.

In-situ extraction generally involves pumping high-pressure steam deep underground. This heats the bitumen to the point that it flows and can be brought up to the surface. If the bitumen has a low enough viscosity that it can be extracted using conventional methods, the in-situ operations do not need to use thermal methods to promote extraction. This sector overview addresses only those sites using thermal extraction methods, as they are much more energy-intensive.

Thermal in-situ facilities have a much smaller physical footprint than surface mining operations, and they do not produce tailings that need to be stored on-site. They also use significantly less water as compared to surface mining facilities. Thermal in-situ facilities are more energy intensive than mines, due to the production of steam. However, new technologies and industry research are focused on [reducing in-situ energy intensity](https://www.cosia.ca/initiatives/greenhouse-gases).
